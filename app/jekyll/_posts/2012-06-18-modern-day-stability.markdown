title: Modern-Day Stability 
---

In the last 12 years, and especially since the 2008 financial crisis, the public’s faith in big institutions has been eroded. With the passage of the PATRIOT Act and the drawn-out wars in the Middle-East, the American public largely lost faith in the government’s ability to deal with national security. And since 2008, nothing has been certain. GM and Ford, which once formed the backbone of the American economy, were on the brink of bankruptcy. People who thought they had great, well-paying, stable jobs at Lehman Brothers were all of a sudden out of work. And with the current state of our healthcare system and the debacle this country is facing, it’s very well possible that medicine is not going to prove to be a guaranteed path to an upper-middle-class lifestyle.

And yet despite all this, a lot of young people are still obsessed with belonging to a big, stable institution, be it a university or a big company. It’s pretty clear why this is—a couple generations ago, belonging to a big, stable institution afforded people a pretty good lifestyle. But now that it is pretty clear that our society’s big, stable institutions aren’t as stable as they once were, we need a different way of thinking about stability and what it means to be risk-averse.

Belonging to a big institution today is a big risk for a couple reasons. As I mentioned before, there is no guarantee that any big corporation is going to always be around, or that any profession will guarantee practitioners a great lifestyle. There’s another reason as well. At big institutions, if you happen to have a boss who you don’t get along with, or you get put in a poorly-performing department, it will hamper your success. In other words, there are a lot of things that can get in your way that you have no control over.

Risk in my books is putting your fate in the hands of factors beyond your control. And by that definition, belonging to any big institution is risky. So while for years belonging to an institution has been considered ‘risk-averse’, it really shouldn’t be.

What then, is somebody who is risk-averse supposed to do? The answer to this is that instead of obsessing over belonging to the right institutions, if you are risk-averse, focus on things that are within your control, like developing skills. The real measures of success in today’s world are going to be what you are capable of rather than what institution you belong to.

A lot of the newest millionaires in this country are blue-collar skilled workers like plumbers and electricians. The bottom line is that experience and skill trump belonging to right institution in today’s world. People make a lot of money doing all kinds of things. Rather than stress about finding a job at the right institution, worry about developing hard skills and being able to depend on yourself.
