title: Building Stuff People Love
---

I've had a productive year. In May of last year, I was figuring out how to build my first web app, eventsalsa.com, and since then, I've built all kinds of things, from a web server written in C to the web backend for an iOS app. I've built numerous smaller things that I put together at hackathons, and I've done some freelance work as well. I just generally enjoy building things.

But the problem I was noticing was that of all the things that I have built, none of them really captivated anybody but myself. What was I doing wrong? I was improving technically for sure, every new project I start I commit to trying out some new kind of technology.

What I’m starting to realize now is that if your goal is to be able to build software that lots of people are going to use and love, technical prowess can only get you so far. The most successful software developers are not necessarily going to the best programmers in the world, or the best at math, in the same way that the most technically brilliant violinist in the world is not going to sell as many albums as Ke$ha.

What matters more is having a keen understanding of what gets people excited and what people like. And it’s a skill that transcends time and media. It’s the reason why JK Rowling has been so wildly successful, despite there being many other fantastic and probably better writers whose work has yet to see light of day. It’s the reason Spielberg’s films have been so popular.

That doesn’t mean that improving technically at whatever craft you pursue is not important—in fact it is very important. But it’s just important to be aware of the fact that being technically adept does not necessarily mean that anybody is going to like what you produce. That is a separate skill.

The thing is, figuring out what people love is not an easy skill to practice. It’s not something that you can schedule in, like piano practice or tennis training. There’s no easy path to acquiring it—it’s not something that you can pick up in any formal institution.

In the last 10 years, backend services for web and mobile applications has been increasingly commoditized, with frameworks like Rails and Django making development quicker and hosting services like Amazon’s EC2 making hosting cheap and easy. As time goes on, it’s only going to get easier. As this happens, having a knack for building products that people will love is increasingly going to be the skill that gets companies their competitive advantages—technical prowess will mean less and less.
