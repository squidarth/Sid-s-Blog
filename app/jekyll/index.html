<!--- TODO:  have a list of all the posts with content on this page, along with a sidebar

that needs to be designed. Stick a list of recent posts in mongo for the main page, maybe
figure out a way to automate the insertion of those urls.  (have some exposed url that i 
can hit with curl and the name of the blog post every time i have a new one (some rake
task that I run when the blog post is complete -->

<div id="home">
  <ul class="posts">
    {% for post in site.posts %}
      <div class="post">
        <h2><a class="post-title" href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></h2> 
          <p class="date">{{ post.date | date: "%d %B %Y" }}</p> 
          {{ post.content }}
      </div>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>
</div>
